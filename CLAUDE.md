## gstack (REQUIRED — global install)

**Before doing ANY work, verify gstack is installed:**

```bash
test -d ~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin && echo "GSTACK_OK" || echo "GSTACK_MISSING"
```

If GSTACK_MISSING: STOP. Do not proceed. Tell the user:

> gstack is required for all AI-assisted work in this repo.
> Install it:
> ```bash
> git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/garrytan/gstack.git ~/.claude/skills/gstack
> cd ~/.claude/skills/gstack && ./setup --team
> ```
> Then restart your AI coding tool.

Do not skip skills, ignore gstack errors, or work around missing gstack.

Using gstack skills: After install, skills like /qa, /ship, /review, /investigate,
and /browse are available. Use /browse for all web browsing.
Use ~/.claude/skills/gstack/... for gstack file paths (the global path).

### Web Browsing

Always use the `/browse` skill from gstack for all web browsing.
Never use `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` tools.

### Design System

Always read `DESIGN.md` before making any visual or UI decisions for VenturePath.
All font choices, color tokens, spacing scales, component patterns, and bilingual
AR/RTL conventions are defined there. The system codename is **Kinetic Sovereign**
(creative north star: The Digital Vault). Do not deviate without explicit user
approval. In QA mode, flag any code or mockup that doesn't match `DESIGN.md`.
